##### Welcome to the Flipit API v2 documentation.

Flipit offers a great API (or Application Programming Interface) to connect with the Flipit platform. Our API allows you to retrieve user info, advertiser info, publishers info and much more.

Getting started with the Flipit API is easy. [Login](https://flipit.com/admin) to your Flipit account, know your API key and check out our documentation about [authentication](http://flipit.com/admin) and our [resources](http://flipit.com/admin), some general and some specific for advertisers or publishers.
